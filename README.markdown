This is a small blog djangoapp I use in [Gryziemy.net](http://gryziemy.net/) and
[Balkonetka](http://balkonetka.pl/). There aren't a lot of bells and whistles, but
it does its task. Entry creation and editing is done through Django's
admin interface. I decided to put in its own project to avoid code duplication.

For the rest of the world it will be probably most interesting as an
example how to write a simple blog application in Django :-)

The documentation is non-existant, but this may change in the future.
